# ecommerce_customer_data
## Project Overview
This is an Excel-based project where I analyzed e-commerce customer behavior to understand how customers interact with products and identify key patterns in sales and retention.
The main goal was to find insights that help businesses understand which customer groups buy more, which product perform better and what factors affect customer returns.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
I started by cleaning the dataset in Excel:
-Removed duplicates and blank records

-Used functions like VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP and IF 

-Checked for missing values and formatted columns for analysis
___
## Data Analysis and KPIs
After cleaning, I used Pivot Tables to analyse data and calculate key performance indicators (KPIs):
| KPI | Value|
|---- |------|
| Total Revenue | ₹2,749,046 |
| Average Order Value | ₹2,741 |
| Return Rate | 40.92% |
| Top Product Category | Clothing |
| Most Active Age Group | Middle-aged |

## Dashboard Insights
-Middle-aged customers made the majority of purchases, contributing the most to sales.

-Seniors had the highest average purchase value, meaning they spent more per order though fewer in number.

-Clothing was the top-performing category, while Electronics had the lowest sales.

-Most purchases were made through card payments.

-Sales peaked in June and dropped in November.

-40.92% of customers returned their products, showing a high churn rate.

## Interpretation
Middle-aged customers are frequent buyers, while senior customers are high-value buyers.

Improving prodct quality and customer satisfaction in the Clothing could reduce returns.

Marketing efforts should focus on retaining middle-aged customers while targeting seniors with high-value offers.
